The application reads two images, applies edge detection, and computes the differences in their edges. The result is displayed with the differences highlighted in red on a black background, making it easy to identify areas of change. This type of analysis has applications in fields like security, medical imaging, and multimedia, where identifying slight differences between two images is crucial. The tool is designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to load images via a graphical interface and immediately see the results.
